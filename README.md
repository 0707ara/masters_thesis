# Visualization and Analysis of Student Data using Machine Learning and Statistical Methods

This repository contains the full master's thesis conducted at Tampere University as part of the Machine Learning and Signal Processing program. The thesis explores the utilization of machine learning and statistical methods for the visualization and analysis of student's academic data.

## Overview
In today's educational landscape, vast amounts of data are generated through various learning platforms, assessments, and interactions. This data holds valuable insights into student performance, behavior, and learning patterns. The aim of this thesis is to leverage advanced techniques from machine learning and statistics to gain a deeper understanding of student data, ultimately enhancing educational practices and outcomes.

## Key Objectives
- **Preprocessing**: Cleaning, formatting, and preparing the collected data for analysis, addressing issues such as missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Employing visualization techniques to explore the characteristics and distributions of the data, identifying patterns, trends, and correlations.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Developing predictive models to forecast student performance based on historical data and relevant features.
- **Statistical Analysis**: Applying statistical methods to validate findings, test hypotheses, and draw meaningful conclusions from the data.
- **Visualization Techniques**: Utilizing PowerBI application to visualize trends effectively, enabling stakeholders to make informed decisions and interventions.

## Repository Structure
- **JoAra_thesis.pdf**: The full master's thesis document.
- **Code**: Contains all the code used for data preprocessing, analysis, modeling, and visualization.
- **Figures**: Visualizations, graphs, and charts generated during the analysis.
- **Applications**: Relevant literature, articles, and resources cited in the thesis.
